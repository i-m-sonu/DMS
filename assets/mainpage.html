            <P>Disasters can strike with devastating force, leaving destruction and despair in their wake. Whether it's
                a natural catastrophe like a hurricane, earthquake, or wildfire, or a human-made disaster such as a
                terrorist attack or industrial accident, the impact can be profound. Lives are disrupted, homes are
                destroyed, and communities are left reeling. The aftermath often requires an immense collaborative
                effort, involving emergency responders, government agencies, nonprofits, and volunteers, to provide
                relief and support to those affected. Disasters also underscore the importance of preparedness,
                resilience, and global cooperation in facing the unpredictable challenges that our world can present.
                Ultimately, in the face of disaster, communities come together to rebuild, demonstrating the resilience
                and strength of the human spirit.</P>

            <p><strong>Types of Disaster: </strong>A disaster whether natural or human-induced is an event that results
                in a
                widespread human loss. It is followed by loss of livelihood, and property causing suffering and loss in
                a
                definite area. Disasters can be of different types based on speed and origin/cause. Based on speed,
                there
                are two types of disaster: Slow onset disaster and Rapid onset disaster. And, based on origin/cause, it
                can
                be of two kinds: natural and man-made disaster</p>
            <h2>Types of Disaster</h2>
            <p>Disaster can be categorized based upon different criteria, as based upon speed, it can be of two types,
                Slow-onset disaster, and Rapid onset disaster. Slow-onset disaster is such type of disaster that occurs
                slowly and slowly over time. Whereas, Rapid onset disaster is a disaster that occurs rapidly without any
                warning. Based upon origin/cause, disasters are of two types, Natural disasters, and man-made disasters.
                Natural Disaster is a disaster that occurs naturally while a man-made disaster which occurs through
                human
                interference</p>

            <p><strong>Tsunami: </strong>A series of long waves hitting shores strongly commonly caused by the
                displacement
                of a large volume of a body of water, mainly on an ocean or a large lake. This type of disaster is
                caused by
                earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, underwater explosions, landslides, glacier calvings, meteorite impacts,
                and
                other disturbances above or below water. The first response to a tsunami is to, &nbsp;Power off all

            <h2>&nbsp;Slow Onset Disaster&nbsp;</h2>
            <p>Slow Onset Disaster that occurs gradually over the years. It impacts slowly &nbsp;The disaster prevails
                for
                many days, months, on even years. Such disaster includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Global Warming</li>
                <li>Climate Change</li>
                <li>Desertification</li>
                <li>Droughts</li>
                <li>Environmental degradation,</li>
                <li>A pest infestation,</li>
                <li>Famine, are an example of a slow-onset disaster.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Global Warming:</strong> Global &nbsp;Warming is the average increase in the earth's temperature
                and
                in the troposphere which contributes to changes in global climate patterns. In common parlance, “global
                warming” is referred to as the warming that can occur as a result of increased emissions of greenhouse
                gases
                from human activities. Global warming occurrence can be both natural and human-induced.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Climate Change: </strong>Climate change is a long-term shifting of temperature and weather
                patterns.
                There are different effects of climate change such as global warming, busing of combustion &amp; fossil
                fuels, the release of carbon dioxide, etc.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Desertification: </strong>Desertification<strong> </strong>is defined as the<strong>
                </strong>degradation of fertile land which later on gets converted into a desert by losing its flora and
                fauna. Desertification is an example of a slow-onset disaster, it can take years to convert fertile land
                into desert. It can be caused because of global warming, climate change, etc.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Drought: </strong>This is defined as the condition which is a moisture deficit relative to the
                average water availability at a given location and season"</p>
            <h2>Rapid Onset Disaster</h2>
            <p>A disaster that is triggered by an instantaneous shock. The impact of this disaster is short-lived or
                long-term. Some examples of rapid-onset disasters are earthquakes, cyclones, flash Floods, volcanic
                eruptions, etc. Impact of this type of disaster is highly impactful as it does not give any time to take
                prevention. The effects caused by rapid-onset disasters are highly shocking as it is causing major
                destruction.</p>
